Demand Forecasting for A Fast-Food Restaurant Chain


Given is the dataset of one of the largest fast-food restaurant chains in the US which  includes    
(1)transaction information such as menu items that were purchased and quantities of each item;   
(2)ingredient lists for individual menu items;   
(3) metadata on restaurants, including location, and store type.  

The data observation window is from early March, 2015 to 06/15/2015 and includes transactional
data from 2 stores in Berkeley, CA and 2 stores in New York, NY.  

Using this information we shall forecast the daily demand for the next two weeks (from 06/16/2015 to 06/29/2015) of one restaurant with Store ID:46673 to
help the managers make inventory replenishment decisions of one specific ingredient: lettuce using both **Holt-Winters and ARIMA methods** in generating the forecast.
